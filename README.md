# Homepage

Project Outline:

This is a project I undertook as part of The Odin Project curriculum. The primary objective of this project was to create responsive homepage portfolio page that would adapt to different screen sizes and look great on mobile, tablet or desktop.
It was also an opportunity to try out some of the new knowledge I learnt about the html picture tag being able to present different images based on media queries as well as using a little wiggle animation on the project cards from what I learnt about transistions and animation.

Challenges: Mainly keeping the CSS tidy and not overly verbose! This could've been done better if more attention was given to how the HTML elements should've been laid out before implementing CSS. Things like positioning the main portrait profile picture outside of it's container and look as though it were sitting on top were tricky but rewarding.
